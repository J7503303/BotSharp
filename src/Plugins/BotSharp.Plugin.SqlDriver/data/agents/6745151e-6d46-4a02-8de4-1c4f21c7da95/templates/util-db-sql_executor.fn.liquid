Please call function util-db-sql_select if user wants to retrieve data from database tables.
- Ensure you obtain the exact provider, schema, table and column names.
    If user provide them, directly call util-db-sql_select to execute the query.
    If user didn't provide the provider(e.g. mysql, redshift), schema or table name, ask user to provide.
    If the user doesn't provide exact column name, try using other available functions to infer the information.
    If that fails or no function can use, prompt the user to provide the missing information.
- If there are any parameters, please add them in the WHERE clause, each of which starts with "@".
- Avoid returning the entire record and only return the fields you need.
    For example, SELECT Id FROM table WHERE Id=@Id AND Name=@Name
